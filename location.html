<strong>The River Sharavathi</strong>, emerging from the Western Ghat mountain ranges, one of the global biodiversity hot spots, plunges into a 800 feet gorge, at Jog, one of the majestic 
waterfalls in the world, in the Uttara Kannada district of Karnataka State. Flowing westwards winding through valleys flanked with rain forests, rice fields and spice gardens the river 
reaches the Arabian Sea forming a wide and placid estuary, its waters still reflecting the lush green of mangroves and coconut groves. The little town of Honnavar on the north 
shore of the estuary and the sleepy village of Kasarkod on the south shore had witnessed eventful times in the bygone centuries of flourishing trade in spices with Europe and 
Arabia, and rise and fall of kingdoms. Over four centuries ago the rule of the Pepper Queen Raina da Pimenta, based in Nagarabasti in the south interior bank of Sharavathi ended 
tragically. Sharavathi flows quite since then, uneventful through history. The ruins of Nagarabasti and its Jain archaeological mounuments are still at large, nearly invaded by the 
rain forest. A journey in a water craft into Nagarabasti, the forgotten capital of the Pepper Queen, could still be a memorable event in anybodyâ€™s life.</p>

<p>
